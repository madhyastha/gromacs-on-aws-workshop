One of the key benefits of AWS is the ability to choose what computers
you use to run analyses. AWS compute resources incur a cost. Therefore,
you can choose how much you want to spend to achieve a certain
performance. The purpose of this chapter is to give you some general
advice about what instances to choose, and some benchmark results to help you
understand how AWS computers compare to your on-premise systems.
