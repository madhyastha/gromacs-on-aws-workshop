If you are taking this workshop as part of a group training, you will get
instructions for how to access your temporary account. 

However, if you are taking this workshop on your own, you may
access the AWS Console through direct sign-in
([here](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/console)) . To log in you will need to enter your AWS Account ID or
alias, IAM user name, and Password.

After you log in, you will see the main AWS Management Console. Yes,
there is a lot here. Take a few minutes to check it out. A search bar is located near the upper left. Recently used services are located below that. Your console may look differently depending on the recently used services. A list of all services can be found below the Services pull-down in the upper left hand corner.

A thorough description of the console is found here:
https://aws.amazon.com/console/

In general, AWS documentation is found here:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/

Support and documentation are also found in the support pull down menu at the upper right of the management console.

**Start by selecting a region** from the pull down in the upper right hand corner. For today, select the **Northern Virginia** region. This region is also known as us-east-1.
