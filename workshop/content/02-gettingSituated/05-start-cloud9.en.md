[AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. We will be using it to introduce you to the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) without the need to install any software on your laptop.

AWS Cloud9 contains a collection of tools that let you code, build, run, test, debug, and release software in the Cloud using your internet browser. The IDE offers support for python, pip, the AWS CLI and provides easy access to AWS resources through the IAM user credentials. With the IDE comes with a terminal that includes sudo privileges to the managed  instance that is hosting your development environment and a pre-authenticated CLI. This makes it easy for you to quickly run commands and directly access AWS services.
